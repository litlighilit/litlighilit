## About Me
An interest-driven developer,
probably (at least used to do) spending too much time seeking and testing features of languages...

- Iâ€™m currently mainly working on [nimpylib](https://github.com/nimpylib/pylib): Write Python in Nim! Compile as C/C++/ObjC or JS ðŸ¤£

## Langs & Work Domain
While had explored quite a few langs, like
C/C++, Rust, Java, JavaScript(ES6), Haskell, Smalltalk, etc,

finally favor
[Nim][nim-web] 
and [Python][py-web].

[nim-web]: https://nim-lang.org
[py-web]: https://www.python.org

My involved fields includes:

- Scienific Computing
- System Utilities
- POSIX development & Windows development
- Automated Tools
- Wrapper
- Framework
- And a little:
  - Image Process
  - GUI
  - frontend & backend
- etc...

Glad to have a technical communication with You!

For example, I've obtained a habit of referring to official language spec reference,

when faced with something unclear,

therefore, I may have known something that's confusing for many,

while it has to be claimed that:

> The more you know, the more you don't know.
